# Homocloud

This project is aimed at designing and implementing a cloud service that utilizes homomorphic encryption to securely and efficiently process sensitive healthcare data. The main objective of the service is to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of patient data while allowing computation on the encrypted data.

## Project Scope

- Receiving sensitive healthcare data from various sources and securely storing it in encrypted form.
- Processing the encrypted data using homomorphic encryption techniques while preserving the privacy and confidentiality of the data.
- Using noise reduction methods such as bootstrapping, squashing, and modulus switching to achieve better asymptotic performance.
- Providing secure access to the processed data to authorized parties.

## Key Features

The following are the key features of the homomorphic encryption healthcare cloud service:

- **Data Privacy and Confidentiality**: The service uses homomorphic encryption to ensure that patient data remains private and confidential at all times, even during computation.
- **Noise Reduction**: The service employs noise reduction techniques such as bootstrapping, squashing, and modulus switching to achieve better asymptotic performance and to reduce the impact of noise produced during computation.
- **Efficient Computation**: The service ensures that computations on the encrypted data are efficient, making it possible to perform complex data processing tasks on large datasets.
- **Secure Access**: The service provides secure access to the processed data to authorized parties using secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Project Deliverables

- **Detailed Design Document**: A detailed design document that describes the architecture, design, and implementation of the cloud service.
- **Code Implementation**: A fully functional code implementation of the cloud service that can be deployed on a cloud platform.

## Major Tech-Stack and libraries

- Python
- Flask
- AWS
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- SQLite

## Conclusion

The homomorphic encryption healthcare cloud service is an important project that addresses the need for secure and efficient processing of sensitive healthcare data. By leveraging the power of homomorphic encryption, the service provides a high degree of privacy and confidentiality while allowing computation on the encrypted data. The noise reduction techniques employed by the service make it possible to achieve better asymptotic performance and to handle the noise produced during computation. The service is a valuable tool for healthcare organizations that need to process large amounts of sensitive data securely and efficiently.
